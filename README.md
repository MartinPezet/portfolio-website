# portfolio-website

This is the code for my personal portfolio website.

## Deployment

This project is going to be deployed using a docker image using nginx for natural load balancing, caching and general web serving ability

I am currently using GitHub Flow with being able to manually push to production using a GitHub Action

To deploy this app the following code is needed to be ran `docker run -d -p 80:80 martinpezet/portfolio-website:{version number from dockerhub}`

This will then run a docker container in the background
